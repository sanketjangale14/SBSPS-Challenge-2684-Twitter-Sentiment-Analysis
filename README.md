# SBSPS-Challenge-2684-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Problem Statement:-
The sentiment analysis of Indians after the extension of lockdown announcements to be analyzed with the relevant #tags on twitter and build a predictive analytics model to understand the behavior of people if the lockdown is further extended.
Also develop a dashboard with visualization of people reaction to the govt announcements on lockdown extension 

Problem Description:-
COVID-19 has exploded into our lives the way no one ever imagined. Naturally, everyone has an opinion and it is inevitably being influenced by the major News channels and media outlets all over the world. Our government has been faced with tons of important decisions and tasks to tackle this pandemic. One of the most important and decisive measures taken in the fight against COVID-19 has been the implementation of a  nationwide Lockdown. This decision was heavily scrutinised and criticized by the masses, especially with regards to the issues of migrant workers, whose very livelihoods depended on daily labour, effect on local businesses, economic slowdown etc. The most convenient and efficient way of expressing one’s opinion or criticism, in today’s world, is by Tweeting. Tweets can make or break some of the important movements in the country. So analysing the tweets on the current situation would give us an insight on the most popular sentiments.

Proposed Solution:-
Dataset will be created and it will contain tweets from the past as well as the present.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be used to convert the sentiments of these tweets into actual visual data which will be easy to comprehend and work on for future needs and decision making.
There will also be an insight on the emotions present in the tweets.
This data will be then visualized onto a UI where the viewer can analyze the sentiments and create charts and graphs.
